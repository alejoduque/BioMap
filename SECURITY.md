# Security Guide - BioMap Application

## üîê Authentication Security

### Issue Fixed
The original application had a hardcoded password (`'manakai'`) in the source code, which was visible in the GitHub repository. This has been fixed with a secure authentication system.

### Current Security Implementation

#### 1. Secure Configuration
- **Separate auth file**: Password moved to `src/config/auth.js`
- **Git ignored**: `src/config/auth.js` is excluded from version control
- **Environment variables**: Support for `REACT_APP_COLLECTOR_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **Example file**: `src/config/auth.example.js` provides a template

#### 2. Password Validation
- Centralized validation function in `src/config/auth.js`
- Consistent validation across all components
- No hardcoded passwords in source code

### Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the interactive setup script
./setup-auth.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp src/config/auth.example.js src/config/auth.js

# Edit the file with your secure password
nano src/config/auth.js
```

#### Option 3: Environment Variable (Production)
```bash
# Set environment variable and build
VITE_COLLECTOR_PASSWORD=your-secure-password npm run build
```

### Security Best Practices

#### 1. Password Requirements
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Minimum 8 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common words or patterns

#### 2. Environment Variables (Production)
```bash
# Set secure environment variable
export VITE_COLLECTOR_PASSWORD="your-very-secure-password"

# Build with environment variable
npm run build
```

#### 3. Regular Password Updates
- Change the collector password regularly
- Use different passwords for development and production
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

### Deployment Security

#### For Ubuntu Server Deployment
```bash
# Set environment variable on server
export VITE_COLLECTOR_PASSWORD="production-secure-password"

# Build with secure password
npm run build

# Deploy using rsync script
./deploy-rsync.sh <SERVER_IP> <USERNAME> /var/www/biomap
```

#### For Vercel Deployment
1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Add environment variable: `VITE_COLLECTOR_PASSWORD`
4. Set the value to your secure password
5. Redeploy the application

### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.js              # üîí SECURE - Contains actual password (gitignored)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.example.js      # üìù EXAMPLE - Template for setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LandingPage.jsx      # ‚úÖ UPDATED - Uses secure validation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LandingPage_backup.jsx # ‚úÖ UPDATED - Uses secure validation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Important Notes

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Points
1. **Never commit `src/config/auth.js`** - It's in `.gitignore`
2. **Use strong passwords** - Avoid default or weak passwords
3. **Environment variables for production** - Don't rely on default values
4. **Regular updates** - Change passwords periodically

#### üîç Verification Steps
1. Check that `src/config/auth.js` is not tracked by git:
   ```bash
   git status src/config/auth.js
   # Should show "untracked" or not appear at all
   ```

2. Verify `.gitignore` contains the auth file:
   ```bash
   grep "auth.js" .gitignore
   # Should show: src/config/auth.js
   ```

3. Test the application with the new password

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Password not working**: Check `src/config/auth.js` exists and has correct password
2. **Build errors**: Ensure `src/config/auth.js` is properly formatted
3. **Environment variable not working**: Verify `VITE_` prefix is used

#### Recovery Steps
If you lose access to the collector mode:
1. Check `src/config/auth.js` for the current password
2. If file is missing, run `./setup-auth.sh` to recreate it
3. For production, check environment variables on your deployment platform

### Additional Security Recommendations

#### 1. HTTPS Only
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure SSL certificates properly
- Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

#### 2. Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for password attempts
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for multiple failed attempts

#### 3. Session Management
- Implement session timeouts
- Clear sensitive data on logout
- Use secure session storage

#### 4. Monitoring
- Log authentication attempts
- Monitor for suspicious activity
- Regular security audits
